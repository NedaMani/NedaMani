Nedaman was originally just a place

**a name tied to my family roots**,

somewhere on the map🗺️.

But I don’t just accept names.

I reshape them😏.

Because that’s what I do:

I see names, ideas, and systems —

not just as they are,

but as they could be.

So I broke it down in Persian:
- Neda(ندا) = a voice, a calling.
- Mani(مانی) = unique, one of a kind.

**And I made it mine: A unique voice🙂**

I gave it a new meaning.

Because I’m not just a developer.

# I’m a re-definer😁
someone who finds new ways to look at old things & searching for new frames
for old ideas.
